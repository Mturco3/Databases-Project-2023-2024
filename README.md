## A Brief Introduction
The following project aims at recreating the functionalities of a "Job Finder Application" by extracting data from a given csv file, while gaining some insightful analysis of the provided dataset. The users will be able to run the suggested queries and insert their desired inputs thanks to our python application with two different interfaces: a **SQL** based interface and a **NoSQL** one.

## To Run Our Application
For the best experience with our app we suggest to run it manually from a new terminal tab set to fullscreen. This is to ensure that the ASCII arts are displayed properly.

### SQL Interface
- To load the Dataset, first run the `main.py` file; in the terminal, the script will ask as input the password for your localhost-root. Wait for the dataset to be fully loaded before continuing.
- To open the application, run the 'application.py' file; again in the terminal, the script will ask as input the password for your localhost-root. Once the password has been correctly inserted, the application will start by displaying the available queries. 
    1) The first query allows the user to explore the 'biased nature' of our dataset by comparing the offered salary and required experience for a selected role between males and females.
